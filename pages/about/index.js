Dentists can then analyse the photos to identify cavities and other dental issues such as gum disease. After the procedure, your dentist will discuss the problems with you and take you through the available treatment plans. After the dental operation, the intraoral camera is used to take more photos to compare the before and after the treatment.</Typography>

                        <Typography className="para">With the recent advances in digital x-ray technologies, you no longer have to worry about ionizing radiation from such procedures. Our Bayswater dentist rely on digital x-rays, which emit way lower radiation, and they can be stored digitally for future sharing and referencing during referrals. The digital x-rays allow our dentists to make an informed diagnosis and providing the most effective treatment plan. Another advantage of digital x-rays over traditional x-rays is that you can ask your dentist at Bayswater Dentist to share with you all your x-rays when you need to get a second opinion.</Typography>

                        <Typography className="para">Soft tissue laser technologies come in handy when operating on soft tissues where focusing electronic laser beams on a target area gently removes the tissue without damaging adjacent tissues. At Bayswater Dentist, we rely on soft tissue laser technology in various procedures such as gingival contouring. The dentist relies on the laser beams to shape the gum tissue as needed. The technology is less invasive, and the adjacent deep tissues heal much faster as they are not damaged during the procedure.</Typography>

Our Bayswater dentist utilizes ultrasonic cleaning and pressure sterilization to maintain maximum hygiene during every dental procedure. The clinic has numerous hand scrubbing spots for our staff and visitors to reduce the probability of any contamination.</Typography>

                        <Typography className="para">Some dental procedures utilize harmful substances such as mercury and amalgam material, resulting in the public water system if not carefully filtered out. Our clinic relies on an amalgam filtration system to filter out these dangerous substances that would otherwise cause harmful side effects on the local population if left to drain out with the rest of the wastewater from the clinic.</Typography>

                        <Typography className="para">At Bayswater Dentist, we recognize that dental anxiety can make patients compromise their dental hygiene out of fear of the dentistâ€™s seat. To help our patients curb their dental anxiety, we provide nitrous oxide sedation with powerful sedative properties that kick in immediately. On top of relieving pain, nitrous oxide makes patients relax during the procedure. The gas is administered via a mask, and the dentist can control how much of the gas gets mixed with oxygen to maintain the ideal sedation. The laughing effect wears out pretty quickly after the mask is withdrawn, allowing patients to resume their daily activities after the dental procedure.</Typography>
