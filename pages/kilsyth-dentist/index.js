                    <Typography className="para mb-3">Dental implants are the most common and best way to replace natural teeth. The installation of implants involves minor surgery to place the implant into the patientâ€™s jawbone. Although the procedure may take several months and a few procedures to complete, the placement of the implant gives the patient permanent artificial teeth.</Typography>

                    <Typography className="para mb-3">Dental crowns are used to restore teeth that have been severely destroyed by decay or injury. As a dental restorative treatment, a dental crown is one of the most commonly used options which can save damaged teeth from extraction. Additionally, they can be used to correct cosmetic imperfections. </Typography>
                    <Typography className="para mb-3">In most cases, the procedure takes about two appointments to complete because the crown has to be customized in the dental laboratory.</Typography>

                    <Typography className="para mb-3">Having your teeth checked by the dentist on a regular basis can help to detect oral issues before they worsen and keep your teeth strong and healthy. During the dental check-up, the dentist will assess your mouth to ensure that everything is okay. </Typography>

                    <Typography className="para mb-3">Scaling and polishing are important procedures as they help to remove hardened tartar that sticks to the teeth. The procedures help in preventing gum recession and gum diseases that can cause shaky teeth and tooth loss. The procedure can also help in removing stains caused by food such as tea, coffee or smoking. It may also help to prevent oral problems like tooth decay and cavities.</Typography>

                    <Typography className="para mb-3">Sealants are made from plastic and are placed on the chewing surfaces of the back teeth to prevent tooth cavities. They are painted on as a fluid and harden to form protection over the teeth. Getting sealants on your teeth can save you a lot of money by safeguarding you from crowns, fillings and other treatments. </Typography>
